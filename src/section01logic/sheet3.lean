# Logic in Lean, example sheet 3 : "not" (`¬`)

We learn about how to manipulate `¬ P` in Lean.

# Important : the definition of `¬ P`

In Lean, `¬ P` is *defined* to mean `P → false`. So `¬ P` and `P → false`
are *definitionally equal*. Check out the explanation of definitional
equality in the "equality" section of Part B of the course notes.

## Tactics

You'll need to know about the tactics from the previous sheets,
and also the following tactics:

* `change`
* `by_contra`
* `by_cases`

-- Throughout this sheet, `P`, `Q` and `R` will denote propositions.
